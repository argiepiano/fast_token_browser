Fast Token Browser
========
Fast Token Browser provides an improved interface for browsing and inserting 
Tokens. It resolves excessive memory usage and unresponsive interface when using
the token browser on a site with a large number of tokens, for example, when
using Entity Tokens. 

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules.

Usage
-----

Fast Token Browser is a drop-in replacement to the default browser provided by
Backdrop.

However, the mechanics of inserting a token work a little differnetly. Instead
of clicking in a text field then clicking a token to insert, first click the
token, then click in a text field where it will be inserted. This is designed to
provide for better keyboard accessibility in a future release.

Fast Token Browser will also replace the token browser provided by Token Help
at admin/reports/tokens.
